*** INTRODUCTION ***

This folder contains the relevant data files from the above publication. This 
dataset is freely available for non-commercial research purposes, but any 
publications and preprints using this dataset must cite the above reference.

In particular, this folder contains clustering data of how different users 
would organize attractions in Paris when planning a hypothetical trip there.
The data was collected using a clustering interface on Amazon Mechanical Turk.
The most pertinent data is how different users created different partial
clusterings.


*** DESCRIPTION OF FILES ***

"attraction_information"
This is a tab delimited file containing attraction ids, attraction names, and 
an associated URL.  All attractions are from Paris.

"attraction_mapping"
This file contains a a sorted list of attraction ids.  This file serves as a 
mapping from the attraction ids in "attraction_information" to a 0-indexed
attraction id used in "clusttering_data".  For example, the first attraction
d232159 maps to 0.

"clustering_data"
This file contains the clusterings created by users.  Each line is a user, and
contains clusters delimited by colons.  Users only cluster attractions that 
they rate as itneresting.  The last group of attractions are attractions that 
the user rated as not interesting, and so are not clustered.

For example, the fist line contains:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9:10 11 12:13 14 15 16:17:18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47
This means that the user created 4 clusters.  The first cluster has attractions
0-9, the second cluster has attractions 10-12, the third cluster has attractions
13-16, and the final cluster has attraction 17.  The user rated attractions 
18-47 as not interesting.  NOTE that we only used the items clustered (and
thus rated interesting by users) in our experiments.

"feature1"
Each line in this file contains tf-idf features of one attraction.  Each line
is synchronized with each line in "attraction_mapping".  Each line is space
delimited, with each feature taking formulation [feature_id]:[feature_value].
All features are text-mined from Wikipedia, so some lines may be empty -- this
happens when we cannot find an associated Wikipedia entry for the attraction.

"feature1_svd"
This is a transfomation of "feature1" using dimensionality reduction via the
singular value decomposition.  This was the actual feature1 dataset used in
the experiments in the paper.

"feature1_text_tfidf"
This is the raw tf-idf information of the attractions, as mined from Wikipedia.

"feature2"
Each line in this file contains keyword tagged features of one attraction. 
Each line is synchronized with each line in "attraction_mapping".  Each line is
space delimited, taking formulation [feature_id]:[feature_value].  The tagging
process is described in Section 5.2 in the paper.

"feature2_keywords"
This is the list of keywords we chose for tagging for "feature2".
